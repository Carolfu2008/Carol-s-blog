# Lists

This is a bullet list:

- item 1,
- item 2.

This is an ordered list:

1. item 3,
2. item 4.

## Equations

This is an inline equation with an inline R code chunk: $\pi = `r pi`$.

This is the Gaussian integral equation: $$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-x^2}~dx = \sqrt{\pi}.$$

## Plots

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.cap="This is a nice plot."}
curve(exp(-x^2), -2.5, 2.5)
```

## Images

![Jekyll Now is the base of this template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/master/images/jekyll-logo.png)<!--CENTER-->

When using the syntax ``![]()`` for an image, it should be centered in your future post after using ``FormatPost``. It should also have a proper caption.
